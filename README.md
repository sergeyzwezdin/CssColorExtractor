CssColorExtractor
=================

Tool which allows you to extract colors from CSS to LESS dictionary.

# How to use

1) Download **dist** folder content

2) Start **CssColorExtractor.exe path**, where *path* is directory, which contains all your stylesheets.

3) Tool will parse all your stylesheets and build **colors.less** file. All colors in stylesheets will be replaced with LESS variables.

# What about SASS?

All LESS-specific things stored in **CssColorExtractor.Less** project. If you need Sass, feel free to build your own **CssColorExtractor.Sass** project and send me pull request :-)
